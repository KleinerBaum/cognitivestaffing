## What it does

1) **Ingest & parse** job ads (PDF/DOCX/URL/text).  
2) **Extract** structured data into a canonical NeedAnalysisProfile (schema + Pydantic models).  
3) **Guide the user** through an 8-step bilingual wizard to review + enrich missing information.  
4) **Generate outputs** (job ad, Boolean search, interview guide, summaries, exports).

The wizard supports German and English job ads and maps common DE/EN section headings (“Ihre Aufgaben / Your Tasks”, “Ihr Profil / Your Profile”, “Benefits / Wir bieten”, …) into the correct fields.

## Wizard flow (UX contract)

> This section is the **source of truth** for how steps must behave.
> If a step feels “unstructured”, it is violating this contract.

### The 8 steps (fixed order)

1. Onboarding / Job Ad
2. Company
3. Team & Structure
4. Role & Tasks
5. Skills & Requirements
6. Compensation / Benefits
7. Hiring Process
8. Summary (Final Review + Exports)

The onboarding step starts with a single hero block (logo + eyebrow/headline/subheadline) plus a primary CTA and a compact three-step timeline, followed immediately by a two-panel URL vs. upload call-to-action with an explicit OR divider so the first screen is focused and uncluttered. The hero copy stays bilingual and directs users to the onboarding source anchor (`#onboarding-source`) to keep the value prop → action flow clear. The onboarding details expander reinforces the extraction process, privacy handling, and accuracy expectations in bilingual copy. Subsequent steps keep the layout focused on the form without any global hero/banner. Secondary messaging stays in helper text or expanders.

Navigation defaults to **linear Back/Next**, but steps can optionally resolve a dynamic next step for branching flows. “Next” is **disabled** until required fields for the current step are filled, with inline validation messaging below the controls.
Steps can be conditionally inactive based on the profile or schema (for example, the Team step may be skipped if the team data model is disabled); navigation and deep links must always land on the nearest active step.

The sidebar Flow mode toggle can switch between the guided multi-step flow and a single-page view that renders all steps in order inside expanders, with a top-level missing-fields summary to validate everything at once.

The Company step owns company profile, contact, and department details (`department.*`) so department follow-ups and missing-field badges appear where the inputs live.
Location follow-ups (`location.*`) are also routed to the Company step to ensure missing prompts surface alongside the location inputs.
Position team follow-ups (`position.team_*`) are routed to the Company step to match where the team structure inputs are rendered.

The Summary step is organized into tabs for **Overview**, **Edit (core company/team/role/skills/compensation/process fields)**, **Exports**, and **Warnings** to keep review, export, and validation in one place. The Exports tab now includes a compact artifact list that centralizes downloads.

### Per-step UI pattern (mandatory)

Every step MUST render in the same top-down pattern:

1) **Known** (readable & optionally editable)  
   - Show what we already have (extraction + previous edits).
   - Keep it compact: summary cards, 2-column layout.

2) **Missing** (dynamic, user-friendly collection)  
   - Ask only what’s missing for THIS step.
   - Use short questions, helpful defaults, and inline explanations.
   - Optional: AI assistants/tools belong in a dedicated “Tools” area (see below).

3) **Validate** (required/critical fields)  
   - Clearly highlight missing required fields.
   - “Next” stays disabled until validation passes.

4) **Next / Back navigation**  
   - One primary action: continue.

Missing prompts should not duplicate inputs that are already editable in the Known tab; inline fields (for example, the Team reporting line) are edited once to avoid conflicting updates.

The Company step now uses the shared `render_step_layout` helper to align with the Known/Missing/Tools structure (`wizard/step_layout.py`).
The Team & Structure step now uses the shared `render_step_layout` helper to align with the Known/Missing/Tools structure (`wizard/step_layout.py`).

### Tools & assistants (UX rule)

AI tools / assistants must NEVER compete with the main “Missing” form.
They should be placed in an **expander** (e.g., “Assistants & Tools”) or a secondary side-panel.

## Architecture (high level)

The repo is organized so schema, domain logic, LLM integration, and UI are separated.

- Entry & routing  
  - `app.py` – Streamlit entry + global layout  
  - `wizard_router.py` – wizard routing + navigation guards  
  - `wizard/navigation/` – navigation state machine, UI controls, and session/query param sync

- Wizard UI  
  - `wizard/`, `wizard_pages/`, `wizard_tools/` – step UIs + wizard utilities (legacy `wizard_pages` proxies the step registry)  
  - `wizard_tools/experimental/` – opt-in stage graph tooling for agent workflows (`ENABLE_AGENT_GRAPH=1`)  
  - `wizard/step_registry.py` – canonical step definitions (metadata + renderers + ordering)  
  - `docs/dev/wizard-steps.md` – developer guide for adding new steps safely  
  - `sidebar/`, `ui_views/`, `components/` – shared UI components  
  - `styles/`, `images/` – styling and assets (including onboarding hero CTA/timeline styles, sidebar hero/stepper theme CSS instead of inline `app.py`, and `.onboarding-source-inputs` layout rules)  
  - `docs/design-system.md` – theme tokens plus onboarding hero CTA/timeline, source input panels, and motion rules for dark/light UI

- Data contract  
  - `schema/need_analysis.schema.json` – canonical schema  
  - `schemas.py`, `models/` – Pydantic/data models

- Missing info & follow-up logic  
  - `critical_fields.json` – critical fields per step  
  - `question_logic.py` + `questions/` – follow-up questions & logic  
  - `role_field_map.json` – role-dependent field priorities
  - `wizard/services/followups.py` – canonical follow-up generation (LLM + fallback)
  - Follow-up responses are schema-validated with JSON repair heuristics, a schema-guided repair retry, and redacted logging before falling back to defaults.
  - `wizard/missing_fields.py` – pure helpers for missing-field detection
  - `wizard/services/` – canonical gap, validation, and job description services shared by UI and agent tools
  - `wizard/step_status.py` – step-level missing required/critical status helpers

- LLM & pipelines  
  - `openai_utils/` – OpenAI client wrapper (Responses vs Chat, retries, fallbacks)  
  - `llm/` – response schemas, prompt assembly  
  - `pipelines/` – ingest → extraction → repair → exports  
  - Structured extraction enforces JSON-only outputs, performs a schema-guided repair retry, and records low-confidence recovery metadata for the wizard flow.
  - ESCO lookups plus extraction/follow-up LLM results are cached per session (keyed by input hashes) to avoid re-running expensive steps on Streamlit reruns.
  - `ingest/`, `nlp/` – parsing + heuristics

- Outputs  
  - `generators/`, `exports/` – job ads, interview guides, Boolean search, etc.  
  - `artifacts/` – generated files / caches

---

## LLM configuration

- **Cost saver toggle (sidebar)**: when enabled, the wizard forces the lightweight model route and clamps `max_completion_tokens` to a tighter ceiling for cheaper, faster responses. Explicit model overrides still take priority if a caller sets one directly.
- **Quick vs. Precise mode**: Quick lowers reasoning effort and Precise raises it; both respect the cost saver toggle when it is enabled.

### Cost controls

Use these environment variables (or Streamlit secrets) to cap spend and steer model choices:

- **`OPENAI_SESSION_TOKEN_LIMIT` / `OPENAI_TOKEN_BUDGET`**: session-wide token budget guard. Once the limit is exceeded, OpenAI calls stop with a bilingual warning.
- **`REASONING_EFFORT`**: hint for reasoning depth (`none`/`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`). Lower values reduce cost; higher values unlock more deliberative responses.
- **`MODEL_ROUTING__<task>` overrides**: per-task model routing overrides (task keys match `ModelTask` in `config/models.py`, e.g. `job_ad`, `interview_guide`, `profile_summary`, `salary_estimate`, `follow_up_questions`).

The sidebar includes a token usage summary with a per-request table (see `sidebar/__init__.py`) so you can review spend while running the wizard.

**Example `.env` (low-cost defaults):**

```bash
OPENAI_SESSION_TOKEN_LIMIT=12000
REASONING_EFFORT=minimal
MODEL_ROUTING__job_ad=gpt-4o-mini
MODEL_ROUTING__interview_guide=gpt-4o-mini
```

**Example `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:**

```toml
OPENAI_TOKEN_BUDGET = "12000"
REASONING_EFFORT = "minimal"
MODEL_ROUTING__job_ad = "gpt-4o-mini"
MODEL_ROUTING__interview_guide = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

## Repository map (where to change what)

### “I want to change the wizard flow / UX”
- Step order, step ownership, required fields:
  - `wizard_router.py`
  - `wizard/navigation/`
  - `wizard_pages/` (step definitions / metadata)
  - `docs/refactor/wizard-unification-audit.md` (maintainability audit + refactor plan)
- Sidebar stepper/progress:
  - `sidebar/`
  - Feature flag: set `st.session_state["feature.sidebar_stepper_v1"] = True` to preview the sidebar stepper.
  - Navigation flag: set `st.session_state["feature.sidebar_stepper_nav_v1"] = True` to allow clicking previous steps in the sidebar stepper.
- Sidebar settings (language, theme, intro banner, advanced LLM options):
  - `sidebar/__init__.py`
- Shared step layout pattern (recommended):
  - `wizard/step_layout.py` *(Known/Missing tabs with optional tools expander)*
  - `wizard/step_scaffold.py` *(add if not present; centralize Known/Missing/Validate/Nav)*
  - `render_step_layout` accepts localized strings or `(de, en)` tuples for titles/intro copy.

### “I want to change which fields are required/critical”
- Required fields (UI gating):
  - Step definitions in `wizard_pages/` and/or step modules
  - Ensure `PAGE_FOLLOWUP_PREFIXES` + `validate_required_fields_by_page` stay aligned (`wizard/metadata.py`, `tests/test_required_fields_mapping.py`)
- Critical fields (follow-up prompts + missing badges):
  - `critical_fields.json`
  - `question_logic.py` / `questions/`

### “I want to add a new field to the profile”
1) Update schema:
   - `schema/need_analysis.schema.json`
2) Update Pydantic/models:
   - `schemas.py` and/or `models/`
3) Ensure normalization defaults:
   - `core/` and/or `utils/`
4) Add it to the correct step:
   - `wizard_pages/<step>.py` + step UI in `wizard_pages/` or `wizard/`
5) Add follow-up question (optional):
   - `questions/` + `question_logic.py`

### “I want to adjust LLM behavior / models”
- Model routing + capabilities:
  - `config/models.py`
- Prompts:
  - `prompts/`
- Client behavior (Responses/Chat, retries, fallbacks):
  - `openai_utils/`
- JSON repair and schema-guided fallback retries:
  - `llm/json_repair.py`

### “I want to add a new export / generator”
- Implement generator:
  - `generators/`
- Wire into export UI:
  - Summary step (final review) in `wizard_pages/` / `ui_views/`
- Write artifact handling:
  - `exports/` and/or `artifacts/`

## Setup & run locally

### Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.11
- OpenAI API key
- (Optional) Poetry

### Install (recommended with Poetry)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KleinerBaum/cognitivestaffing.git
cd cognitivestaffing

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

poetry install
```

---

## Testing

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Streamlit AppTest regression checks (including the ESCO selector state guard) run in the same
`pytest` suite and do not require network access.

The test suite also validates that rule-based extraction fields stay aligned with the canonical
NeedAnalysis schema, so rule path drift fails fast in CI.

Job ad fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/job_ads/`. Use the helper in
`tests/fixtures/job_ads/__init__.py` to load UTF-8 fixture text for regression
tests.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Optional flow helpers (for example, company autofill suggestions) may be unavailable in slim flow
  variants; missing optional dependencies are expected and only logged at debug level.
- If you encounter “missing ScriptRunContext” warnings, ensure background tasks only compute data
  and keep Streamlit UI/session-state updates on the main thread.
- Recoverable wizard failures now surface a retry button and a UI-only reset option; prefer UI
  resets before clearing the full profile to avoid losing captured data.
- ESCO occupation selector state is split between widget and profile keys to avoid Streamlit
  session-state mutation errors; keep widget changes on `ui.position.esco_occupation_widget`.
- Avoid committing binary screenshots in PRs; add any required images manually after review to
  keep diffs lightweight.
